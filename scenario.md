# Summery Vale Information System (SiS) Scenario

This scenario involves a high school called Summery Vale High. The school wants to develop an information system to support its educational activities.

The school has several educational branchs. Each branch provides at least one academic track. Each track is made up of some subjects, where a subject may be on several tracks. A student enrolls on a track and every year takes a particular number of subjects. tracks usually have at least two students registered. Every student is assigned a guidance counselor at the start of the track, who is a staff member in the branch providing the track. A staff member works for a branch and usually teaches on several subjects. Each subject has a subject tutor who is also a staff member. A staff member may be tutor for several subjects.

Each branch is chaired by a senior teacher, who is a staff member and works for the same branch. The system must makes a note of when a senior teacher became the chair of a branch. The details of a branch include its name, a primary location / address where its main building is located, a secondary address for helpdesk-style queries when needed, telephone and fax numbers, etc.

Each track is assigned a track leader (a staff member), who manages the day-to-day issues of the track. Details of a track include a name, whether it is a junior-high, high or associate degree track, standard duration of the track in months and the number of credit hours to complete the track.

For each subject, the system needs to store its details (e.g., title, number of credit hours, level (j, h, a), etc). For each student who is doing a subject, the system needs to record grades.

For each student, the system needs to store personal details such as name (first, middle, last), term address (number, street, city, region, zip code, etc), home address, phone numbers, email, date of birth, gender, and details of closest relative (e.g., name, address, relationship to student, phone numbers). The system needs to record whether a student is from the UK, EU, Commonwealth or other.

Each staff member is assigned a line manager, who is also a staff member and works in the same branch. Details of a staff member include name, address, office room number and building location, phone extension, email address, home and mobile phone numbers, data of birth, gender, closest relative details, salary, date joined the school, and details of qualifications. The system needs to record how many weekly hours a staff member is expected to be teaching on that subject.
