# sql-pl-sql
This is an edited version of an assignment I submitted as part of my MSc CS degree which demonstrates my SQL and PL/SQL skills and has been adapted.

## Oracle SQL RDBMS from scenario
This section of the assignment involved a scenario with a ficticious high school Summery Vale High. This system will include all education aspects, such as tracks, subjects, students, staff, branches and all relevant information.

# Things I am particularly proud of
1. Implementing an auto-increment feature.
2. Creating a PL/SQL procedure to check the validity of the staff-student tutoring relationships to ensure they are in the same department.
